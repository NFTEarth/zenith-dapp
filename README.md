We plan to support and Zenith Protocol build the ultimate LSDfi on Arbitrum and other L2s to be the premier protocol for LSTs and provide the NFTfi support needed for both projects to thrive. 

Zenith Protocol is a LSDfi protocol that creates innovative utility in DeFi by focusing on Arbitrum. Using LSTs as collateral, users can mint zUSD. Based on the overall architecture of MakerDAO, but with enhancements to tokenomic design such as vote escrowed utility for stakers in a ve8020 model inspired by Balancer. The protocol consist of two tokens - the governance and value acccrual token ZNT and the stablecoin zUSD. 

NFTEarth aims to help facilitate the growth of LSDfi on Arbitrum in a significant way - and then the growth of NFTfi using bleeding-edge tech such as token-bound accounts and the ERC-4626 standard for yield optimization.
